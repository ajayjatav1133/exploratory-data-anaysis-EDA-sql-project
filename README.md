## üåü About Me

I am Ajay Kumar, a dedicated and enthusiastic Electronics and Communication Engineering student at NIT Bhopal, with a strong passion for data analytics and SQL-driven insights. Coming from a humble background, I believe in the power of knowledge and hard work to transform data into meaningful results that can create real-world impact.

During my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in data analysis, database management, and exploratory data analytics (EDA). Through my project ‚ÄúExploratory Data Analysis using SQL‚Äù, I explored large datasets to uncover hidden trends, correlations, and performance metrics using SQL queries and analytical functions.
I focused on various aspects of EDA such as dimension exploration, measure analysis, magnitude evaluation, and ranking analysis, which helped me understand how raw data can be converted into actionable business insights.

This project not only strengthened my command over SQL and data manipulation techniques, but also improved my analytical reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making abilities. It gave me a clear vision of how structured data exploration forms the foundation for data-driven decision-making and business intelligence.

My goal is to grow as a data analyst who can combine technical expertise with logical thinking to solve complex problems efficiently. I am continuously learning advanced data analytics, visualization, and machine learning tools to expand my skill set and prepare for a professional career in data and analytics.
